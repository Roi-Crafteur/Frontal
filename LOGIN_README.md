### Form Validation
The current implementation includes basic validation. You can enhance it by:
- Adding more sophisticated email validation
- Implementing password strength requirements
- Adding CAPTCHA or other security measures

## Security Notes
This is a demo implementation. For production use:
- Implement proper server-side authentication
- Use HTTPS
- Add rate limiting
